name: "TeamCity: Remove branches used for nightly test"

# TeamCity should use a newly created branches that matches the pattern `nightly-test` and is the only branch matching that pattern. We rename past nightly test branches to avoid there being more than one `nightly-test` branch (i.e. only one branch that matches the filter (+:nightly-test). This workflow also removes renamed branches once they get past a certain age.
